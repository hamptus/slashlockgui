## Install

Install slashlock in seconds on [Ubuntu and other snap supported Linux distributions](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install) with:

    snap install slashlock

Installing a snap is very quick. Snaps are secure. They are isolated with all of their dependencies. Snaps also auto update when a new version is released.
